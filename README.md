# Rabin-Karp Algorithm

To design and implement a string matching operation using the Rabin-Karp (RK) algorithm is
based on the concept of hashing. This algorithm was authored by Rabin and Karp in 1987 and is
an effective way of finding patterns from a paragraph. String matching operation is a core part of
many text processing applications such as data mining, pattern recognition, design of compilers,
text editors, etc. Thus, locating patterns in a text efficiently is very important and is a crucial task.
